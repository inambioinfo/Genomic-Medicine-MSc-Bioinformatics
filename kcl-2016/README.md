One aim of Genomic Medicine is to find clinically actionable variants to help with diagnosis, guide treatment and improve health care of an individual. Briefly describe some of the progress we have made towards this aim through the application of Next Generation Sequencing Technologies.

In addition, outline the basic steps involved in the analysis and interpretation of clinical/diagnostic NGS data (from raw sequence data to variant calls and clinical interpretation), and, briefly summarise the major points of the current clinical guidelines for "Evaluation of Pathogenicity and the Reporting of Sequence Variants" .

Describe and discuss the Bioinformatic Challenges (technical and analytical challenges) of Next Generation Sequencing in the context of large-scale Genomic Medicine initiatives such as Genomics England:The 100,000 Genome Project (http://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/)
